## Description 

Weather Dashboard is a full-stack web application that provides users with real-time weather information for cities across the United States. The application is built with a responsive client-side interface and a robust server-side service that fetches weather data from third-party APIs. Users can search for any U.S. city to get current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a detailed description of the weather. Additionally, the application displays a weather forecast to help users plan their activities.
